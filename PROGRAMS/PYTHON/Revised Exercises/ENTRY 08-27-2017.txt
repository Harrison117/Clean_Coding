Well..... So far, so good!

The moment I finished a chapter of "Clean Code", it really left me thinking about what I have done
  to my old codes back in my freshman CS classes. Imagine the horror in seeing my old, near-unreadable
  codes. Then something sparked in me; what if I make the programs again but this time, cleaner?

Well, here it is :D

I revised 4 programs so far in an effort to make my coding readable (and hopefully cleaner than the
  old code, if not the cleanest code I've made). I've gotta admit; it's so damn hard to name variables.
  At least I practiced a little during the time I was programming in C (these programs here are
  programmed in Python though).

It's a good progress Maybe I could move on to C after I've done revising my codes about file
  manipulation in Python.

Then I could brush up my function writing skills again and read that chapter in the book =3

On the other note: It's good to be back in python again!
